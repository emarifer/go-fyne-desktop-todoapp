INSTALLING fToDo App:
=====================

Since the supplied executable contains everything needed to run on Windows,
it can be considered portable software.
This means that you can run it from any location by simply double-clicking on it.

However, if you want to use it as an "installed" application
you can place the executable in the directory "C:\Program Files".
You will then need to add it to the system PATH as explained here:

================================================================================

Enjoy it!!
